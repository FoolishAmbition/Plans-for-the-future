Plans for the future - duration, timeline, goals

My ultimate goal by the end of next year, 2024 latest by mid 2025, to design a HRSS system on a website, covering the **basics** of a payroll system, attendance, and HR management services in a Singapore-based context with it's regulatory laws.
To do that I would first have to 
Step 1. Learn Python - this includes learning the applications for python, and choosing which one to focus on for the goal.
  - mostly focusing on web development and using it's framework.
      - Need to consider using Django, and learning Frontend Integration - frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Step 2. Learn frameworks
